Hi Thanks for downloading.

If you want to try then run the 'free antivirus.vbp' and download the defs, run.

if you want to compile to exe and compile realtime module 'scanner.dll' then you 
have to add 3 tlb files to your project refrences. these are given in the 
required.rar file.

after compiling keep 'av.exe', 'av.mdb' and 'scanner.dll' and 'detected.wav' in a folder (not root drive)
and execute av.exe and then press yes to load its tray icon then from tray icon 
goto options and click enable realtime scanner.


then it will fully functional.
The realtime scanner only works in winxp or lower. Not on win vista or 7.

i had checked all error and cleared. Re uploaded the mdb file. if more errors occured during your test then 
mail me.

thanks
